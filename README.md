# Softmar-Team-5
 Noon Day Reporting in Low/no network connectivity

This zip file contains three folders: softmar client, softmar server, and softmar scheduler. 
 - To initiate the softmar client, begin by installing the necessary node modules using the command ```npm i```, followed by starting the client with ```npm start```. 
 - For the softmar server, similarly install node modules with ```npm i``` and then initiate the server using the command ```node server.js```. 

To ensure continuous data synchronization, even when the browser is closed, put the Python script in the softmar scheduler folder into the "Task Scheduler" of your system.
